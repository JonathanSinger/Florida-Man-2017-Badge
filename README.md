### FAQ
**What does this thing do?**

The gator acts as a shield inline with the WEMOS and charger stack.

**Where is the power switch?**

Deal with it. Just unplug the battery.

**This has 2 USB ports!**

The top one is for programming, the bottom one is for charging. They can both be used for USB power.

**It doesn't work you asshole!**

Are you sure? Does the twinkle screensaver show? If you are VERY sure the battery is charged and it's still not working... email nothingness00 (at) gmail for help.

**Is this all it does?**

Come to the FLORIDA_MAN party to see the real magic!

**I flashed some other program. How do I get the stock code for the party back?**

We will provide flashing services at the party.

**I hacked your WIFI bro!**

That's nice. I would love to hear how you did it. Maybe we can incorporate your success in the party magic. email nothingness00 (at) gmail
