Unique custom digial badge created to support the party.

You can still buy them in person at DEF CON! Contact @JonathanSinger on Twitter

### Assembly
Adhere the battery flat and centered on the back of the badge. Run the battery wire under the charging board and around to the connecting plug.

Each shield can be removed for other fun projects. If you want to charge the battery without the lights on, just unplug the charge shield from the gator and run separately.

### FAQ
**What does this thing do?**

The gator acts as a shield inline with the WEMOS and charger stack.

**Where is the power switch?**

Deal with it. Just unplug the battery.

**This has 2 USB ports!**

The top one is for programming, the bottom one is for charging. They can both be used for USB power.

**It doesn't work you asshole!**

Are you sure? Does the twinkle screensaver show? If you are VERY sure the battery is charged and it's still not working... email nothingness00 (at) gmail for help.

**Is this all it does?**

Come to the FLORIDA_MAN party to see the real magic!

**I flashed some other program. How do I get the stock code for the party back?**

We will provide flashing services at the party.

**I hacked your WIFI bro!**

That's nice. I would love to hear how you did it. Maybe we can incorporate your success in the party magic. email nothingness00 (at) gmail
